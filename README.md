# Java Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Java repository! This is where I document my progress as I learn Java programming. It contains my practice codes, logic building exercises, and solutions to various algorithmic problems.

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is organized by topic and complexity:

* **Basics/**: Fundamental Java concepts, syntax practice, and simple input/output programs.
* **Nested-Loops/**: Pattern printing, matrix operations, and loop-based logic.
* **Arcade-Mode/**: 🎮 Fun, gamified projects (like Doraemon Bank & Secret Spy Decoder) that teach concepts like OOP, Loops, and Logic through storytelling.
* **Problem Solutions**: Various competitive programming solutions and logic challenges found in the root directory.

## 🧠 Topics Covered
* Data Types & Variables
* Control Flow Statements (If-Else, Switch)
* Loops (For, While, Do-While)
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) - *Learned through Arcade Mode!*
* Pattern Printing
* Logical Problem Solving

## 🏆 Featured Projects
* [**QuizMaster**](https://github.com/Anand2k29/QuizMaster)
  * A Java-based quiz application developed as a certified project for the **Vidyarthi** course.
  * This project demonstrates my understanding of core Java concepts, logic building, and application flow.
